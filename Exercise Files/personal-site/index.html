    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>I haven't yet started my web development career, but I started learning in December 2024. Along the way, I've already finished The Odin Project, learned by Interviewbit, done lots of fun little projects for practicing. These days, I learn through LinkedIn Learning. To learn more about my work history, check out my <a href="#" target="_blank">LinkedIn profile</a>. Thanks for stopping by!</p>

    <p>Here's a quote from one of my favorite singers:</p>
    <blockquote cite="https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/2112402.Demi_Lovato">
      <p>The best advice I can give to anyone going through a rough patch is to never be afraid to ask for help.</p>
    </blockquote>
