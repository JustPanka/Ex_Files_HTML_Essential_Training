  <h2>About me</h2>
  <p>I haven't yet started my web development career, but I started learning in December 2024. Along the way, I've already finished The Odin Project, learned by Interviewbit, done lots of fun little projects for practicing. These days, I learn through LinkedIn Learning. To learn more about my work history, check out my LinkedIn profile. Thanks for stopping by!</p>

  <p>Here's a quote from one of my favorite singers:</p>
  <blockquote cite="https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/2112402.Demi_Lovato">
    <p>The best advice I can give to anyone going through a rough patch is to never be afraid to ask for help.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>-Demi Lovato, from "<cite>Stay Strong</cite>"</p>
